        CSS, JavaScript, and a working knowledge of React. As a recent graduate,
        I have focused on strengthening my practical skills through
        self-learning, online courses, and hands-on personal projects. I have
        developed responsive, user-friendly web interfaces and small
        applications, including a weather app using APIs, a task management
        tool, and this portfolio website. My approach to development emphasizes
        clean, maintainable code, accessibility, and performance. <br />I am
        proficient with version control systems such as Git and GitHub, and I
        follow industry best practices in layout structuring, responsive design,
        and basic debugging. I have experience translating UI/UX designs into
        functional interfaces and working with browser developer tools to test
        and optimize layouts. In addition to technical skills, I bring strong
        problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and a consistent work
        ethic. I am capable of working both independently and collaboratively,
        and I communicate effectively with peers and team members. <br />I am
        currently expanding my skills in modern frameworks, learning more about
        component-based architecture, and exploring tools like Tailwind CSS and
        basic deployment methods. I am highly motivated to contribute to
        real-world development projects and eager to take on challenges that
        help me grow. My goal is to secure an entry-level frontend development
        role where I can apply my knowledge, learn from experienced
        professionals, and continue building meaningful digital experiences. */}
